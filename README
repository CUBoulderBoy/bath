BATH

In the initial version of bath, only ssh is supported (and there is no installer yet, so you need to do this manually.

The python files go in /var/lib/bath/app
The database and pid file get created in /var/lib/bath

bath.sh is a shell script that connects to the webpage using curl for instances where a web browser is cumbersome, or just not available.

REQUIREMENTS
 - python 2.7
	 - python-ipaddr
	 - python-daemon
	 - python-lockfile

 - sudo (but not the version with this bug (http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tools.sudo.user/3838)). See ISSUES
 - apache2 w/ssl mod_python
 - iptables


INSTALLATION

First, you need to install apache (or really, anything that honors 'REMOTE_ADDR' and 'AUTHENTICATE_UID' with ssl (because not using ssl kind of defeats the purpose). If you are using apache2, this is the config you need to make bath work (aside from ssl and all the relevant stuff for that):
----------------------------------
Alias /bath /var/lib/bath/app

<Location /bath>
  Options FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride None
  DirectoryIndex bath.py
  AddHandler mod_python .py
  PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
</Location>
----------------------------------

These lines needs to be in the /etc/sudoers file:
----------------------------------
# Cmnd alias specification
Cmnd_Alias CREATESSH = /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j REJECT -m comment --comment *
Cmnd_Alias ADDSSH = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT -s *
Cmnd_Alias DELSSH = /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT -s *
Cmnd_Alias SHOWSSH = /sbin/iptables -n -L INPUT
www-data                ALL=NOPASSWD: CREATESSH, ADDSSH, DELSSH, SHOWSSH
----------------------------------

the bathd script is the init file that starts the daemon, and should go into /etc/init.d/

CONFIG

take a look at /var/lib/bath/app/config.py
pay particular attnetion to the iptable rules, which must match with what's been put in the /etc/sudoers file

PIDFILE in the init script must match the pidfile in the config if you wish to use the init script

Admins:
to set up your user as an admin, edit the admin directory in the sqlite database (this database is created either by the daemon running, or the first time someone accesses the website.  The following command will add a user for you (bath.db should be owned by apache user, so you need to run this with root priveleges)

sqlite3 bath.db "INSERT INTO admin VALUES('ADMINUSER', 1);"

ISSUES

sudo -n: some versions of sudo do not like not having a tty allocated. To get around this, use 'sudo -n'

hanging process (iptables, /bin/sh) or no return values: Some older versionf of sudo (such as 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.3 0) do not terminate properly. In Debian, this is fixed by backporting the Wheezy sudo package to squeeze. 1.8.3p2-1.1 is the version known to work.
